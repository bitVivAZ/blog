I have huge passion for eSports, especially for DOTA 2 and thought it would be a great way and oppurtinity to learn Django and Python by creating a website for Severe Gaming, a multi gaming organization that I manage and used to play for. 

Going into this project I only really knew HTML and CSS, however after a few coding tutorials on YouTube I learned the basics of Django and BootStrap in no time. Since this was my first time creating a website and designing one I had no idea how I wanted it to look like until one of our previous Counter-Strike players made our awesome banner. After seeing it and browsing codepen and different websites to draw inspiration from I had a solid idea and vision of how I wanted it to look like.

Currently the website only has a register and login page to create articles. The rest I still have to add through the admin dashboard. This is definitly something I would like to change in the future if the site and organization grows with time however for now I don't think its neccesary.

This project will always be close to my heart since this was my first 'big project'. I've learned so much by making this website and hosting it through DigitalOcean.
