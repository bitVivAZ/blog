This application was developed as a prototype challenge founded at [zaio.io](https://zaio.io/) which assists student developers build an IT skills profile through coding challenges and practical experience. This prototype challenge was given to me after finishing a series of video tutorials that included HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript and Node.JS (which I was new to). The prototype challenge stated as follows:
<blockquote>
Create an Auth System that uses a simple html forms as the UI. You will be need to make 2 html pages, one for sign in 
and one for sign up. Design your own database architecture to store the sign up details in the database. The user should 
be able to sign in after they have signed up. When the user signs up the user should be notified ‘You have signed up’. 
When the user signs in, the user should be notified ‘You have signed in’.  You may only use the programming language or 
framework you chose as your Specialisation to attempt this challenge. There is no correct answer for this, brain storm 
and just make what you think is right.
</blockquote>
The next part of the prototype challenge was:
<blockquote>
Create a sign in system when the user can edit his profile and save it and then log out. Assume the user is a student,
he should be able to change his name, surname , age, degree and his favourite course. You may only use the programming 
language or frame that you chose for your specialisation. There is no correct asnwer for this, do what you feel is right 
and think, do what you feel is right.
</blockquote>
