A Puzzle Platformer developed using the Godot engine.

After seeing this pixel art tileset and demo from [0x72](https://0x72.itch.io), I just knew that I wanted to recreate it in the Godot Engine. This game is a puzzle-platformer, where you move around and solve problems by hitting mirrors, switches and fireballs.

This was my first game created using the Godot engine. The Godot engine uses GDScript which is a python-like programming language.

This was a huge learning experience. Iâ€™ve learned a lot by creating this game in terms of programming and the Godot engine itself.

Plat at: [NewGrounds](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/730897) or [Itch.io](https://vivaz.itch.io/shadow-of-deception)

Things I would do differently next project:

- Create a full state machine
- Use global scripts rather then excessive over use of signals
- Name function better

The keys are:

- Arrow keys to move around
- Z - Resets Level
- X - Attack
- C - Jump
